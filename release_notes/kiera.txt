Your assistant is now live on this device. Current capabilities:

• Conversational replies: Chat in plain language and get full answers (when an LLM API key is configured).
• Message storage: Inbound and outbound text is saved for memory and search.
• Idea engine: Use /idea <text> to save an idea, /ideas to list recent ideas, /idea_search <query> to find ideas by meaning. You can also type #ideaengine in any message to capture it as an idea.
• Semantic memory: Messages and ideas are embedded so you can search and recall by meaning.
• API usage tracking: Token usage is recorded and available at /api-usage when LLM is enabled.

You can ask me "what's new?", "what can you do?", or "how do I save an idea?" anytime.
